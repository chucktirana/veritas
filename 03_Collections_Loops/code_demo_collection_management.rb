#Arrays and Hashes
#TIME: 25 min
#INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN NOTES:
# => You can change the values in the hashes or arrays. Make it personal to you.
# => Make sure to emphasize that a hash is a dictionary (e.g. phone book) so students can relate
# => Provide this file (minus these instructions) to students so they can follow along
#and focus on logic and understanding rather than stress over syntax.
# => In class labs for hashes are a stepping stone to using JSON returned string from the Mashable and Reddit in the Teddit app.



# Print the name of each of the 3 stooges
# If you call `puts` without any parameters, it will output an empty line
# Use that to space out your output nicely


#
# This works with Hashes as well


# What about an array of hashes?

# Explain how the `each do` syntax is the same as `each {`
# (i.e. at a high level, explain that blocks can be {} or do/end)


# What about a hash with an array as a value?
# Notice the formatting
# Explain that ruby 2.0 syntax is OPTIONAL and the string key syntax
# will not go away anytime soon


# Start with a collection that looks like our Twitter response. I've kept only the parts we care about.
